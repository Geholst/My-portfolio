# My-portfolio

## Description

  I made this website so I can show my portfolio and past projects to any employer who may be interested in me. I learned alot in making this website, I became alot more proficient with using flexboxes and how to add hyperlinks to a website. One thing I definetly learned when making this website is that I need to get a lot better at staying consistent when naming my sections, because I got kind of confused when one section is numbered and one section is labelled after what it contains. I can also get a lot better at consolidating my code

## Usage

  I added hyperlinks in this website so anyone that wants to learn more about projects I've worked on have easy access to it. 
  I also added links to my Email and Github so that people can contact me if they want to learn more about me.
